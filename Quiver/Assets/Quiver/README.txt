Quiver//REQUIREMENTS:
-Unity5.3.xxx or later
-VTL SimTimeControls
-A ground object, terrain or other surface collider on its own layer

Quiver//SETUP:
-Place the Quiver Prefab in the scene
-Create or use and existing UI Canvas and place the SimTimeControls Prefab within.
-Compare your Quiver object's inspector with the provided sample.
-Ensure the Arrow, FileIndicator, and Vector Labels prefabs are assigned in the Quiver inspector
-Assign the SimTimeControls you just created to the appropriate place in the Quiver object's inspector
-If necessary, create a layer to contain the arrow objects and the ground/terrain object(s) and assign those to their respect places on the Quiver object's inspector
-Place all datafiles to be used in a folder titled "Resources" in the Assets folder of your project. It is very important that all files used are in Assets/Resources, otherwise the cannot be read and will throw an error. Do not include any other subfolders. 
-Assign files from the Resources folder to the Data Files list in the Quiver object's inspector
-Assign values to the Area Dimensions. These describe the area within which the vectors will populate, using the Quiver's transform as the origin. If you need to "flip" the data, reverse the sign on the corresponding axis. Ensure there is ground/terrain underneath any portion within the white box where data might be generated by moving the Quiver object in the scene. Rotation does not affect the generation of vectors.

Quiver//NOTES:
-To speed up playback, increase the SimTimeControls>SpeedControlSlider Max Value to 16
